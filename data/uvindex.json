    "● Check the UV index",
    "-> Monitor the UV index regularly, especially before planning outdoor activities.",
    "-> Limit outdoor exposure when the UV index is high (typically >3), as UV radiation levels are most intense during these times.",
    "-> Adjust sun protection measures accordingly based on the UV index forecast for the day.",
    "-> The UV Index predicts the ultraviolet radiation levels on a 1-11+ scale, helping people determine appropriate sun-protective behaviors. Find your area’s UV index rating via the weather tab (whatever the exact name of the table is on the bottom of the app’s home page) to determine the necessary precautions."
