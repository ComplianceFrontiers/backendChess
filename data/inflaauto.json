    "-> May also be accompanied by dryness, scaling, and fissuring",
    ">> Cause for Irritant:",
    "-> Damage to the skin barrier by repeated exposure to irritants (e.g. soaps, detergents, solvents, and chemicals), leading to increased transepidermal water loss",

    "-> May be itchy",
    ">> Cause for Seborrheic Dermatitis:",
    "-> Increased sebaceous gland activity provides a lipid-rich environment that supports the proliferation of Malassezia yeast, causing an inflammatory response",
